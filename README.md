# Optimizers

## Code structure

All of our code can be found under the `notebooks` folder in our repository. 

## Commands to Reproduce Experiments

In order to run the notebooks we recommend the usage of Google Colab notebooks. 

## Task

The task that we are studying is using VGGNet to do image classfication. 

## Model Architecture

The model is is modelled after VGGNet and involves 4 convolutional layers and then a linear layer to allow for classifications.

## Datasets

We evaluate our approach on 3 publically avaliable datasets. 

#### CIFAR-10

This dataset contains 60k color images which are uniformly distributed accross 10 classes. The images are of size 4x32x32.

#### STL-10

#### Caltech-101

This dataset consists of colour images of objects belonging to 101 classes.
